Planned Branching Strategy

Main Branch --> Updated to latest kedro version without any integration eg mlflow or prefect or airflow

Tag for each version of kedro eg: 0.17.6, 0.17.7, 0.18.0

Feature Branches and tags with integrations. These could also be just explorations if and possibly without any tagging.

The image below shows how I plan to add tags.
